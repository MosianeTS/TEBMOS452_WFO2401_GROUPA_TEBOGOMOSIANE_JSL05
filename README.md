# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator

### Galaxy Playlist Generator

In this challenge, I had to use the `map()` function and other Javascript methods such as filter() to create a personalized "Awesome Mix" playlist for each of the Guardians of the Galaxy. I had to organize songs based on each Guardian's musical preference, displaying a playlist tailored just for them.

Tech Stack:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript

#### Reflections

 For this challenge, I initially struggled with how I would dynamically display data to the browser without having to create elements in HTML. After some persistence and problem-solving, I managed to succeed. It was a great exercise to practice manipulating the DOM and also using JavasScript methods for data manipulation.
